== branch
* `step03-accept-being-invasive-for-downstream`

== goal
* we use maven to depend on `slf4j-spike-cmd` as a library
* we want to use the slf4j we like, without opinion from `slf4j-spike-cmd`

== explanation
* since `slf4j-spike-cmd` we onboard an slf4j implementation (loback) and slf4j-spike-cmd embarks his (slf4j-simple)..
* we want to avoid having two implementations in the classpath
* we will now need to add some `excludes` on `slf4j-spike-cmd` 

== problem found
* not very clean to exclude dependencies from upstream
* but required here

== advantages
* now we can use the implementation we like (logback)
