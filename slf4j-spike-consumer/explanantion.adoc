== branch
* `step02-depend-on-slf4j-simplementation-breaks-consumer`

== goal
* we use maven to depend on `slf4j-spike-cmd` as a library
* we want to use the slf4j we like, without opinion from `slf4j-spike-cmd`

== explanation
* since `slf4j-spike-cmd` we onboard an slf4j implementation (loback) and slf4j-spike-cmd embarks his (slf4j-simple)..
* we now have two implementations in the classpath

== problem found
* this issues an warning message

----
SLF4J(W): Class path contains multiple SLF4J providers.
SLF4J(W): Found provider [org.slf4j.simple.SimpleServiceProvider@3b81a1bc]
SLF4J(W): Found provider [ch.qos.logback.classic.spi.LogbackServiceProvider@64616ca2]
SLF4J(W): See https://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#multiple_bindings for an explanation.
----

* and in the end the wrong implementation can be used

----
# we wanted to use logback
SLF4J(I): Actual provider is of type [org.slf4j.simple.SimpleServiceProvider@3b81a1bc]
----

== advantages
* none for us :-(
