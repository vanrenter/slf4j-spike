== Buy the slf4j story
* From the philosophy of slf4j
** your code only depends on `slf4j-api`
** you need some implementation in the classpath to actually log something with slf4j
** if you are building a library, don't make a dependency on a specific slf4j implementation

OK, This makes sense

== The problem
* My code is built and packaged with maven
* My code is both a library and a command line tool
* So, probably, I'm building both
** a jar : for the library
** an uberjar : for the comand line tool (so I can call it with java -jar mytool.jar xxx)
* So, somehow, I need an implementation for the command line tool
* But I need not to package on for the library


== the tries
* by the book
** Don't depend on any slf4j implementation
*** But it does not work simply with 

== Potential solutions
* the manual option
* the maven-shade-plugin + slf4j-simple
* the springboot-build-plugin + slf4j-simple
* the logback track
* split the maven artifact
