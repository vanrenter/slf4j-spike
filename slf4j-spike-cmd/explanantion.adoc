== branch
* `step01-naive`

== goal
* we want to use slf4j
* we want to log to the command line (were are a cli tool, here)
* we want to be good citizen and don't force use of a specific slf4j implementation to maven downstream (look at slf4j-spike-consumer)

== explanation
* here, we do a really silly implementation
** we don't reference any slf4j implementation
** of course, it won't work and complain that no slf4j implementation has been found
* We can try to be clever and add it at runtime (`runit.sh`)
** It won't work either

== problem found
* adding an slf4j based implementation by `-classpath slf4j-xxx.jar` won't work
** we already have an `org.slf4j` package inside our fatjar
** that will prevent any addition to classpath via a jar

== advantages
* we didn't break the `slf4j-spike-consumer` as maven does not reference any slf4j implementation
