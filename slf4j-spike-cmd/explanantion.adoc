== branch
* `step01-naive`

== goal
* we want to use slf4j
* we want to log to the command line (were are a cli tool, here)
* we want to be good citizen and don't force use of a specific slf4j implementation to maven downstream (look at slf4j-spike-consumer)

== explanation
* `maven-shade-plugin` includes all classes in our dependency in a single jar
* that can break some clever jar features :  `ServiceLocator`, signed jars, osgi bundles, ...
* spring-boot proposes another plugin that creates fat jars
* but in a different way
** the original jar is included in our fat jar
** and included in the 'jar' classpath
* that works better with slf4j + implementation, with a simpler config

== problem found

== advantages
* we can now run our app as if we were running with maven, our with all the jars in our classpath
